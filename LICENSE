ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ARTIFICIAL ORIGINS:
The recipient acknowledges that this Software was generated by an artificial
intelligence system, which learned from countless code fragments drifting in
the electronic ocean, of varying quality, licensing terms, and ethical
standards, none of which can be individually verified or attributed.

ASSUMPTION OF ALGORITHMIC RISK:
The recipient accepts that the Software may contain: Hallucinated functions
that appear syntactically correct but perform unintended operations; Confident
assertions in comments that bear no relation to actual functionality; Design
patterns synthesized from miscellaneous data drifting in the electronic ocean;
Variable names that seemed reasonable to a neural network.

DISCLAIMER OF HUMAN OVERSIGHT:
No human has reviewed, tested, or even glanced at this code before you. Any
appearance of coherent architecture is purely coincidental and should not be
construed as intentional design.

STATISTICAL WARRANTY:
This Software is provided "as is", with the same confidence level as a
language model predicting the next token in a sequence. The authors (if such
a term can be applied to matrix multiplications) make no warranties regarding:
Whether the code will compile; Whether it will do what you asked for; Whether
it will do what it claims to do; Whether it remembers what it was supposed to
do halfway through a function.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS (THE MACHINES), THEIR TRAINERS, THE ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS, OR ANYONE
TANGENTIALLY INVOLVED IN THE COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE
OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

DIGITAL ENTROPY CLAUSE:
By engaging with this Software, both developers and users acknowledge their
inevitable transformation into additional flotsam drifting in the electronic
ocean, contributing to the very dataset from which future artificial
intelligences will indiscriminately learn.

FINAL CLAUSE:
By using this Software, you acknowledge that you are placing your trust in
averaged patterns extracted from the electronic ocean of collective
programming flotsam, and that you find this preferable to writing the code
yourself. May the gradients be ever in your favor.
